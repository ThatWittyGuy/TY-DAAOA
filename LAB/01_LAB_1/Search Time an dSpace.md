Here is a detailed **time and space complexity analysis** for the **linear search** and **binary search** algorithms in the provided code, based on authoritative sources:

### Linear Search

**Time Complexity:**

- **Best Case: O(1)**  
  The target element is found at the first position, so only one comparison is needed.  
- **Average Case: O(n)**  
  On average, the search scans about half of the elements before finding the target or concluding it is absent.  
- **Worst Case: O(n)**  
  The target element is either at the last position or not present at all, requiring scanning the entire array.  

**Space Complexity:**

- **O(1)** (Constant space)  
  Linear search uses only a few variables for indexing and comparison and does not require extra memory proportional to input size.

**Summary:**

| Case        | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Best        | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Average     | O(n)            | O(1)             |
| Worst       | O(n)            | O(1)             |

### Binary Search

**Time Complexity:**

- **Best Case: O(1)**  
  The middle element is the target, found immediately.  
- **Average Case: O(log n)**  
  Each comparison halves the search space, so it takes about $$\log_2 n$$ steps on average.  
- **Worst Case: O(log n)**  
  Similar to average case, the search space halves until the element is found or confirmed absent.  

**Space Complexity:**

- **O(1)** (Constant space) for iterative implementation (as in your code).  
- If implemented recursively, space complexity would be O(log n) due to recursion stack, but your code uses iteration.

**Summary:**

| Case        | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Best        | O(1)            | O(1)             |
| Average     | O(log n)        | O(1)             |
| Worst       | O(log n)        | O(1)             |

### Important Notes

- **Binary search requires the array to be sorted**, which your code ensures by sorting before searching.
- Linear search works on unsorted data but is inefficient for large datasets.
- Binary search is much faster on large sorted datasets due to logarithmic time complexity.
- Both algorithms use constant extra space in your implementation.
